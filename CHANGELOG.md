# Changelog

Each `## [x.y.z]` heading is a release. Merging a PR that adds a new heading at the top
publishes that version (see `.github/workflows/release.yml`).

Versioning for art:

- **Major**: an asset is removed or renamed, or its size or anchor changes. Games must be checked before upgrading.
- **Minor**: new assets added. Safe to upgrade.
- **Patch**: an existing asset repainted with the same file name, size and anchor. Safe to upgrade.

## [0.1.0]

- First release: folder layout, house rules and an empty manifest. No art yet; lets the games
  install the kit and test their update script.
